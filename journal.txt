Title:
Proteins and excipients - Computation and informatics approach 
Abstract:
Simple MD of lysozyme and citrate.
Introduction:
Investigate interations between proteins and excipients.
Some work has already been done on this (Kalayan et al 2016).
Methodology:
MD simulations using amber (Rahman et al 2016).
Results:
We saw citrate interacting with positively charged residues.
Conclusion:
More time required.
Acknowledgments:
We are very greatful for the EU funding that we'll never see again!
